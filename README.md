This is a sample application of how to connect Spring Security with Google OpenIdConnect.
This is a fork of the original contribution of [fromi spring-google-openidconnect] (https://github.com/fromi/spring-google-openidconnect) wich allow to use Google OpenIdConnect with a standard spring security form login. This allow the user to not have to use his password and verify his identity (email) using google.

Application is build using Spring Boot and Java 8.

To test, please configure file application.properties with your client id and secret obtained with [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
